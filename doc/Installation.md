## Installation

The preferred way to install this library is to rely on Composer. Just check on Packagist the version you want to install (in the following example, we used "1.0") and add it to your `composer.json`:

	{
	    "require": {
	        // ...
	        "spomky-lab/otphp": "1.0"
	    }
	}
