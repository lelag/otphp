## Quick overview of using One Time Passwords on your phone

* OTP's involve a shared secret, stored both on the phone and the server
* OTP's can be generated on a phone without internet connectivity(AT&T mode)
* OTP's should always be used as a second factor of authentication(if your phone is lost, you account is still secured with a password)
* Google Authenticator allows you to store multiple OTP secrets and provision those using a QR Code(no more typing in the secret)
